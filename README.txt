Repository with simple example of autoencoder and classifier on MNIST, in pytorch.

Requirements can be installed using conda environment file in this directory.

Plan is to make a more complicated text autoencoder with combined reconstruction/BLEU score loss (BLEU evaluated at bottleneck), but simple examples will be left simple for those interested in learning.
